Wall painting machine

For students who are at a loss with their mobile phones, please click the View code above to see the program and manual. Some mobile phones cannot read the pdf online, you can download it and read it again.
Download is to download the zip package file by pressing the green Clone or Download button.

If you still canâ€™t, please Google to see how GitHub is used, or give up and go to https://create.arduino.cc/editor/wjd76/f6e291a3-1061-4218-b583-fa0fd5550cfb/preview to compile with web version compiler

You can also go to our store's watermelon video to watch the tutorial https://www.ixigua.com/home/2123847662571084/

It is recommended to directly use the web version compiler of the Arduino.cc official website. Some content may be more convenient after turning over the wall. I recommend a turning over tool, https://github.com/bannedbook/fanqiang/wiki
